WARNING: the ResourcefulRoutes plugin is experimental. The API might
change in the future. Looking at the ResourcefulRoutes plugin source code
can give you a deeper understanding of how plugins and helpers work in
Mojolicious and it also provides you with a suggestion how to create a bunch
of RESTful routes with a single command.
